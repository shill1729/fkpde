#' Thomas algorithm for solving tridiagonal linear systems. Stability only for diagonally dominant or symmetric positive definite.
#'
#' @param a lower diagonal of matrix
#' @param b diagonal of matrix
#' @param c upper diagonal of matrix
#' @param d vector on RHS of equation
#'
#' @description {Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal linear systems. This can be used to solve
#' PDEs arising from Feynman-Kac connections.}
#' @details {The algorithm is on wikipedia and quite straightforward.}
